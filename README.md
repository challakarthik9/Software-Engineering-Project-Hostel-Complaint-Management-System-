# Software-Engineering-Project-Hostel-Complaint-Management-System-
Currently in hostels, complaints are recorded in books. The complaints are filled but it is tough to find the pending complaints since it is written on different pages of a book. Also, different types of complaints are all registered in the same book. When a technician in a particular field goes through the book to fix the complaint it will be hard to keep track of which complaints come under his domain. Hence, categorization of complaints is not done while registering them on books.  The hostel authorities face issues regarding fixing of complaints in the hostel. The complaints are recorded in a notebook and it is difficult to keep track of which complaint is already fixed and which is not.  We are creating a website in such a way that there is a provision for the hostel complaints in the website. While registering a complaint you will have to choose the type of complaint. Any types of complaints are welcome
